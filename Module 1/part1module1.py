# Module 1: Critical Thinking Part 1
 # Get the inputs for num1 and num2
num1 = float(input("First number input: "))
num2 = float(input("Second number input: "))

# Finds the addition and subtraction of the two numbers 
sum = num1 + num2 
difference = num1 - num2

# Shows the results
print("The addition of the two numbers entered are: ", sum)
print("The subtraction of the two numbers entered are: ", difference)
